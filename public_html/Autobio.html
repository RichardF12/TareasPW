    <h1><u>Autobiography of Ricardo Pérez</u></h1>

    <h2><u>Chapter 1 - Introduction</u></h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ricardo.p.montes.5">Ricardo José Pérez Montes</a>, and this is my Autobiography. 
    We all know that our lives begin with out parents, and since I actually don’t know how they met, I’ll just tell you their names.<br>
    My lovely mum’s name is Claudia Beatriz Montes Arevalo and my dad’s name is Ricardo Antonio Pérez Miranda, as you might’ve noticed I was named after my father,
    just like he was named after his father, so unless there’s another Ricardo Pérez up on the family tree, I am Ricardo Pérez the Third.</p>

    <p>Enough about my name, let’s move on to more of me, let’s see, this template says that I can explain the meaning and origin of my name, so let’s do that.</p>

    <p>Well, my name, <b>Ricardo</b>, is the spanish and portuguese cognate of the name <b>Richard</b>, which originates from the german name <b>Ricohard</b>, 
    that’s amazing. Now for the meaning, apparently Ricardo means <i>Powerful/Great(or Brave) Leader</i>, though I haven’t demonstrated any affinity to leadership,
    maybe in the future I will.</p>
    
    <p>Also while I was investigating the meaning of my name I bumped into <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ricardo">this</a> 
    and it literally made my day, so, Néstor, if your reading this thank you for this assignment, you're awesome, and sorry I uploaded this like 40 hours late.</p>

    <p>The template says I should talk about my personality, so I’ll do it fast. I’m a really shy person, 
    I don’t speak a lot because I dread small talk and unnecessary sound in general, 
    I mean I tend to use <b>quiet</b> as a description of how to make me a little bit happier, but when I’m drunk I actually get quite talkative, 
    and by quite I mean "to the point where you either give me more booze to make me shut the hell up and hope I pass out, or you send me to someone else and walk away";
    what else? ohh yeah, I’m lazy <strong>af</strong>, I think that I am socially awkward, though some of my friends differ, I’m not a social person,
    I have low self-esteem and I am a little short fused so some people tend to find me rude, yeah that’s about it.</p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 2 - Family & Friends</u></h2>

    <p>Well this one’s gonna be short, I don’t have much to say about my family, my father's side of the family is quite affectionate and supportive 
    but I've lost contact with that part of my family in general, I see my father once a month and my cousin a couple times per week cause he also studies at UCA, 
    but we don't talk much, I kinda hope we did but we don't even though he was like my only friend for most of my childhood, but that's not important righ now;
    on my mum's side of the family I'm the spoiled child, I was the first grandkid my grandparents had, the first son my mum ever had and the first nephew,
    so everyone loved me, I can say for a fact that as a child I had everything I wanted, I mean I was pretty much and only child until I was like 10 I think,
    maybe more, so I continued to grow as an only child with a brother the size of a potato, a reaaally big potato.
    and now as an adolscent/young adult I am still a little spoiled, not that I am complaining, and I have most of the things I want and all that I need.</p>

    <p>My mum is the epitome of love, she Is the most amazing person I know and I admire her and want to be like her when I grow up, 
    my grandma Is super supportive of almost everything I do and makes delicious food so I know where to go when I need to eat something good,
    and then we have my grandpa, he is a difficult person to deal with and I must say I am still adjusting to living with him and to him in general,
    but one thing I can say is that he is amazing, he helps me in everything he can, he cooks my food for the week because I have colitits and have a very specific diet,
    and even though he's had to cook the same 3 or 4 dishes on a week to week basis for the last 8 months he always finds a way to make them taste not only different 
    but <b>better</b>, like a <strong><i><u>loooooot</u></i></strong> better, he takes also takes care of me, 
    and even though just like him I'm quite difficult to deal with, he manages to do it and keep me overall happy,
    I'm really grateful for having him as my grandpa.</p>

    <p>As for friends, I have 5 close friends;
    First and foremost we have <b>Xinthya</b>, she is the most amazing girl I know I love her with all my heart,
    she is the one person who I know I can just bump into and end up having a 3 hour conversation/debate about potatoes, not that we do it, but we know we can,
    we've done worse, she loves music, as much as I love science, which we could describe as <i>n</i> if <i>n = (infinity + infinity)^infinity</i>, 
    she's my <strong>BFF</strong>, and there's simply no denying that.</p>

    <p>Second we have <b>Camila</b>, I met her before meeting Xinthya, though I think we became friends through Xinthya, 
    after all Xinthya's first bff since forever is Camila; Camila and I met when we where kids at school and we are like half cousins or something,
    but when we were kids I don't even remember why, we fought, like for everything, we where pretty much bullying each other for like 2 or 3 years I think,
    until we just stopped fighting and interacting with each other, apart from what was necessary, not because we couldn't nor because we hated each other, 
    but because we where past the fighting part of the childhood and never actually had anything in common<br>
    after like 2 years I think we started to have an acquaintance type of relationship and it wasn't until 2015 when I became friends with Xinthya,
    that I also became actual friends with her, now having the back story straight, Camila is <strong>the most</strong> caring person I know,
    she takes care of us and she's the cliche mother figure of the group, but she's also <strong>bad shit crazy</strong>, I mean,
    that you can actually be walking with her talking about life and suddenly she dissapears and will be found doing the craziest things possible, 
    I won't give any examples and leave that to your Imagination.</p>

    <p>Now comes <b>Mai</b>, I met her at uni just like the next 2 on this list, she is by far one of the <strong>smartest and most passionate</strong> people I know,
    she Is the one and only person I have met that has the most things in common with me, we are so nsync that we end up completing each other's sentences 
    and things like that, we are both around the same level of Insanity and have complementing thought processes and personalities, which makes things even better,
    she is my one and only official <b>Moirail</b>, when there's something new in my life she's the first one to know, and even though we don't actually see each other
    that much just like every one else on this list I know that I am her Moirail too.</p>

    <p>Now comes my little <b>Angel</b>, though her name is actually <b>Angela</b>, she is also one of the <em>top 3</em>smartest persons I know, 
    when I need someone to talk about anything, or someone to basically pick me up from the ground when I'm down, that's her, she is second only to Camila
    when it comes to caring and pretty much kicks some really nice ass when it comes to everything else, 
    her unique drive and self-everything make me admire her as a person almost as much as I admire my mum, she is strong and independent and caring and supportive 
    and also she's crazy. She is one of the newest additions to my collection of rays of sunshine but I'm pretty sure she shines brighter the sun.</p>

    <p>And to finish off the list is <b>Elsy</b>, she likes gay guys for the most part and by that I mean yaoi, so yeah, she's my Free Fujoshi she's crazy smart and funny,
    though she, just like me is relatively shy and doesn't talk much, just get a yaoi pic in front of her and she'll tell you the name of the artist,
    I am still getting to know her though, so I don't really know much about her except for the fact that she's an amazing person and she really likes gay guys,
    specially when they're kissing xD.</p>

    <p>Now that I think about it I'm like frickin' Charlie, is he had 5 Angels and his name was Richard XD.</p> 
    
    <h2><u>Chapter 3 - Firsts</u></h2>

    <p>Now that I come to think about it I actually haven't had any memorable firsts in my life, most of what I've done has been quite basic,
    not saying I'm a basic bitch but sometimes I think I could be, so let's just leave it at that.</p>

    <h2><u><b>Chapter 4 - Sports/Activities/Hobbies</b></u></h2>

    <p>Simple, I'm not a sports person, not am I an active person, my definition of a good day is staying in bed half day with my computer and eating ice cream, 
    just to go watch a movie (usually a romantic comedy or a comedy or an action comedy or a romantic or musicals) and then go back home just to 
    Netflix and chill until I fall asleep.</p>
    
    <p>My hobbies are Watching movies, I love movies, even the ones that I know are complete and total horse shit, I also love watching series,
    though with series I'm more picky than with movies, I love music In general, playing it even though I don't know how to and listening to it
    are some of my favourite things, and videogames, cause escaping this shitty life can't be done any other way. That's about it for this chapter.</p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 5 - Dreams & Hopes</u></h2>

    <h3>Goals</h3>

    <p>My goals are simple actually, I want to graduate, get a stable and rewarding in more than only the monetary sense job,
    and I want to be able to make my mum proud, that's all I aim for as of now.</p>

    <h3>Dreams</h3>

    <p>When it comes to my dreams, I never know what to answer because I don't really know what I dream about, what drives me to succeed,
    I have still to discover that, though there is actually something that I could say I've wanted since as far as I can remember and that is,
    that I want to have a PhD that, and a loving partner with whom I can share my achievements with and maybe farther into the future have some kids or maybe not,
    that I still don't know.</p>

    <h3>Hope</h3>

    <p>And as for where do I hope to be in 10 years, well, I honestly don't know, I hope I have a Job and live in my own apartment or house,
    maybe living with my loving partner, whom I hope I meet and stay with somewhere within those 10 years, obviously graduated and also studying my first
    or second master's degree, making my mum proud.</p>

    <h3>Song that describes me as a person</h3>

    <p>Ok so I don't have a song that describes me as a person <i>per se</i>, but I'm a romantic that is the one thing I am a 100% no fake sure about myself, 
    and so I will share with you my favourite song which pretty much depicts one of the things I most desire, to find <i>True Love</i>, it's cheesy I know,
    but it's true, so I leave you with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoFylcrxdM0">Always by Panic! At The Disco</a>, so well bye and thanks for reading.</p>
